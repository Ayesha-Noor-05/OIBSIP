House Price Prediction

Overview

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, location, and more. It uses regression techniques to understand how each feature impacts the final selling price of a property.


Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict house prices accurately.
Analyze feature importance to understand what factors influence pricing the most.
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics like R² score and MAE.

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains historical housing data with features such as:
price	,area,	bedrooms,	bathrooms,	stories,	mainroad,	guestroom	basement,	hotwaterheating	,airconditioning,	parking	prefarea,	furnishingstatus


🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization
Scikit-learn – for machine learning models
Jupyter Notebook – for prototyping


🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Detected outliers and handled missing values(using boxplots)
used one hot encoding for furnishingstatus
Transformed price using price tranformation

🧪 Model Used
Linear Regression


📊 Model Performance

Metric	Value

mean squared error 0.014134986916349524
R2 score 0.9109283007135403

Future Improvements

Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
