Wine Quality Prediction

📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties (like acidity, sugar content, and pH). The task was treated as a classification problem.

🎯 Objective

Predict wine quality using supervised machine learning.
Handle class imbalance by restructuring the classification labels.
Identify key chemical properties that influence wine quality.

📁 Dataset

This dataset contains 1143 rows and 13 columns

Features:

Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol

Quality (score between 0–10)



⚠️ Class Imbalance

Most wine samples had quality scores of 5 and 6, making the dataset highly imbalanced.

To handle this, we re-categorized wine quality into 3 broader classes:

Low Quality → 3–4

Medium Quality → 5–6

High Quality → 7–8


🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn 

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Alcohol and volatile acidity were most correlated with quality.

🔮 Future Work

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit

Test on unseen wine samples or newer datasets
